👋 Hi, I'm Anthony Duong! I’m a Software Engineer passionate about
making end-to-end solutions.

## About me

With a background in Computer Science and experience working in both start-ups as well freelancing
experience, I bring a unique experience of adaptability, communication, and technical prowess to
any project I do.

## Technical Skills 🛠️

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Lua, C, C++, C#
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, .NET
- **Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, Docker, Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Services.
- Database: MySQL, postgreSQL, DynamoDB

## Key Projects 📚

- **[Hitch](https://github.com/orgs/HitchApp115/repositories):** Mobile app designed for drivers to share their planned routes with potential riders. This platform enables passengers
to request to join trips if the driver's destination aligns closely with their own desired route. This system offers
drivers the opportunity to earn extra income by accommodating passengers on journeys they are already
undertaking. My application used React-Native for the frontend and Node.js as the backend with a MySQL
Database.
- **[Learning-Site](https://github.com/anthonyduong789/Learning-Site):**  Scientific studies have shown that incorporating random 10-second pauses into
 practice sessions can significantly speed up the learning process whether it be
 for learning an instrument or language. Gap-Tech is a simple, easy-to-use
 web-app that allows users to customize their practice sessions with random
 pauses. In addition, has other useful tools to help with focus. Made this for my
 Rhythms of North India class to help learn an instrument
- **[ForumFlow](https://github.com/ForumFlow/ForumFlow):** Web application that enhances user engagement by allowing users to upload
 FAQs and host discussion sessions similar to Reddit forums for their
 presentations. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management,
 React for a responsive frontend, and C# with the .NET framework for a robust
 backend. Currently, the application is in active development.

## Leadership & Advocacy 🌟
- **Vets Who Code:** As the Executive Director, I have transformed traditional educational models by integrating advanced technology and data analytics to better serve veteran students.
